## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Contribution Workflow

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue a pull request.
